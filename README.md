# phytoplankton-project
This python project is made to evaluate the evolution of the features of the phytoplankton by using the datas given by the IFCB.

There are three python files to use for the evaluation : a functions file, a file to save the different features and an other file to plot the features of the pytoplankton. We can adapt these files with every data given by ICFB by modifying the lines 9 and 15 of the functions files. Indeed, these lines correspond to the data files used. So, before to use the python project, you have to download the datas you are interested in from the IFCB. (https://ifcb-data.whoi.edu/timeline?dataset=mvco&bin=IFCB5_2017_274_153307).

To use this python project, it is necessary to have the pandas, numpy, os and matplotlib libraries downloaded.
